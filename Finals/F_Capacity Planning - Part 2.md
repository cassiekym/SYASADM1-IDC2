**Network Analysis**

**Potential Bottlenecks**

1. **ISP Dependency**

   The network's connectivity is provided by a single ISP. The network as a whole will not have access to outside resources if the ISP goes down. The network is extremely susceptible to ISP interruptions due to this lack of redundancy.  

2. **Edge Router Vulnerability**

   During times of high traffic, the single edge router could get overloaded. All devices and services would experience a total loss of network connectivity in the event of its breakdown. As a result, the infrastructure develops a critical single point of failure. 

3. **Layer 3 Switch Limitation**

   If there is heavy traffic, the central Layer 3 switch may become a bottleneck. Communication between VLANs and linked servers would be disrupted in the event of this device failing. This makes it a critical dependency for the network's overall functionality. 

4. **Layer 2 Switches**

   For connectivity, each VLAN is dependent on an individual Layer 2 switch. All of the devices in that VLAN would be unable to access the network if the switch malfunctioned or was overloaded. The likelihood of localized network disruptions is increased by this reliance on a single device.  

5. **Server Capacity**

   The network may not be able to manage a significant spike in traffic with just five servers. Due to limited processing and storage capacity, performance issues are likely to occur during times of high usage. The server configuration is not scalable enough to accommodate increasing needs.

**Security Risks**

**Lack of a Firewall**

There is no firewall on the network to filter both inbound and outbound traffic. As a result, the infrastructure becomes vulnerable to external threats including malware, denial-of-service attacks, and unauthorized access. The network is significantly more susceptible to cyberattacks in the absence of this crucial security layer.

**Capacity Limitations**

1. **Limited Server Resources**

   The current servers are unable to efficiently manage heavy traffic volumes. Due to resource exhaustion, the network may experience delays or interruptions during times of high demand. This restriction makes it more challenging for the system to function reliably when there exists significant traffic.

2. **Scalability Limitations**

   Only two PCs can be connected to each server, which limits the network's capacity to grow. Due to this restriction, additional devices cannot be added. This lack of adaptability will cause operational issues as the company grows.

**Scalability Planning**

**Proposed Solutions**

1. **Additional ISP**

   The addition of a secondary ISP offers redundancy and guarantees network connectivity in the event that the first ISP fails.

Lessens the effect of individual switch failures and improves network dependability.   | Necessitates a large outlay of funds for extra hardware.  Makes setting up and maintaining redundancy techniques like link aggregation and spanning trees more difficult.  |

4. **Additional Layer 2 Switches in the Access Layer**

More devices can be connected to the network by adding extra Layer 2 switches at the access layer.

| Benefits | Drawbacks |
| ----- | ----- |
| Enhances scalability and future-proofs the infrastructure by making it simpler to add new devices to the network. Distributes device connections over several switches, lowering the possibility of access layer overload.  Balances traffic loads, improving network performance.    | Higher hardware expenses and more room is needed for the positioning of the switch.  Additional configuration and cabling may be needed, which would increase the deployment effort. |

**Evaluation of Solutions**

**Evaluation and Justification**

The proposed solutions aim to address the network's scalability, reliability, and security in the face of increased traffic during peak periods. Below is a thorough evaluation of each proposed solution, considering key factors such as cost, complexity, and potential impact.

1. **Additional ISP**

   **Cost:** Higher operating costs will result from adding a second ISP because it will be required to pay for additional bandwidth and maintain two different contracts. Even though this can be quite costly, the improvement in network performance and dependability during periods of high traffic makes it desirable.  

   **Complexity:** Setting up two ISPs complicates the network configuration, particularly when it comes to load balancing and failover procedures. Routing protocols (such BGP or OSPF) must be configured correctly and with seamless failover, which calls for thorough preparation and experience. 

   **Potential Impact:** Adding a second ISP significantly improves the network's resilience and guarantees continuous service even in the event that one ISP goes down. The network can use load balancing to lessen congestion during periods of high traffic, which will enhance user experience and preserve service continuity.

2. **Backup Edge Router**

   **Cost:** The purchase and maintenance of a backup edge router represent a moderate cost increase.  Nonetheless, this expense is required to guarantee network continuity in the event of router failures, particularly during times of high demand when the likelihood of failure is raised.  

   **Complexity:** Adding a second router adds further intricacy to the network architecture. This involves setting up failover management routing protocols like HSRP or VRRP and making sure traffic is appropriately split between the primary and backup routers.  

   **Potential Impact:** By guaranteeing network connectivity even in the case of router failure, a backup edge router significantly improves fault tolerance. This lowers the possibility of a single point of failure, which is essential for preserving service availability, and guarantees little interruption during instances of high traffic.

3. **Redundant Multilayer and Layer 2 Switches**

   **Cost:** The initial hardware investment required to enable redundant core switches is expensive. Costs are further increased by the continuous configuration and maintenance of these devices.  

   **Complexity:** Configuring network protocols like STP (Spanning Tree Protocol), link aggregation, and even Virtual LANs (VLANs) adds complexity to the process of setting up redundant switches. Network professionals with the required abilities are needed to manage this redundancy and make sure it performs without loops or unwanted downtime. 

   **Potential Impact:** Better fault tolerance and traffic distribution are offered by this system. Through the establishment of additional communication channels between devices and VLANs, the network can better manage higher traffic loads. Additionally, redundancy improves availability by reducing the possibility that a single switch failure may affect the network.

4. **Additional Layer 2 Switches in the Access Layer**

   **Cost:** As it requires purchasing extra hardware as well as updating the wiring infrastructure, adding more Layer 2 switches at the access layer comes at a considerable cost.  

   **Complexity:** The configuration of this solution becomes more complicated, particularly when it comes to load balancing among switches, link aggregation, and VLAN design. In contrast to other solutions, the complexity is manageable.  

   **Potential Impact:** More devices can be supported and the traffic load can be distributed more equally across the access layer due to the additional switches. As the network expands, this scalability will be essential for avoiding congestion and possible access layer overloads, which could impair network performance as a whole.

5. **Additional Servers for VLAN Distribution**

   **Cost:** It takes an initial substantial investment in both hardware and software configurations to add servers to each VLAN. These extra servers will also require continuing resource management and maintenance, which will cost funds.   

   **Complexity:** Workload distribution, load balancing, and failover settings must all be carefully considered while configuring the new servers within each VLAN. To guarantee seamless functioning, proper integration with current systems is crucial.  

   **Potential Impact:** The network's capacity to manage more traffic and offer fault tolerance inside each VLAN is enhanced by the additional servers. By distributing services like load balancing, database, and web hosting among several servers, it is possible to prevent any one server from becoming a bottleneck and enhance system performance even during periods of high traffic.

**Conclusion**

By incorporating these solutions, the current network's major bottlenecks and scalability issues will be resolved. The network can manage the anticipated peak traffic during the product launches and sale events due to the suggested solutions. These solutions also greatly improve network resilience, fault tolerance, and performance during high-traffic hours.
