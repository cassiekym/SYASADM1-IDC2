# **SYSADM1 â€“ Capacity Management & Planning**

**Part 2\. Network Scalability Analysis**

Recall the e-commerce website scenario we discussed earlier. Given the expected surge in traffic, analyze the provided network topology diagram. Identify potential bottlenecks and areas where scalability might be a concern. Propose specific strategies to improve the network's scalability and performance to ensure a seamless user experience during the peak traffic period. Consider factors such as increased user demand, new applications, and security threats.
